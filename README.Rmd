Rduinoiot provides an easy way to connect to Arduino Iot Cloud API with R.
Functions allows to exploit API methods for many purposes, manage your Arduino devices and dashboards and access to the data produced by sensors and sketches.

## Installation

You can install the development version of Rduinoiot from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("FlavioLeccese92/Rduinoiot")
```

## Example

Reading real-time humidity sensor of one of your devices can be done like this:

```{r example}
library(Rduinoiot)
# Sys.setenv(ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_ID = 'INSERT CLIENT_ID HERE')
# Sys.setenv(ARDUINO_API_CLIENT_SECRET = 'INSERT CLIENT_SECRET HERE')
create_auth_token()

thing_id = "b6822400-2f35-4d93-b3e7-be919bdc5eba"
property_id = "d1134fe1-6519-49f1-afd8-7fe9e891e778"

things_properties_timeseries(thing_id = thing_id, property_id = property_id,
                             desc = FALSE, interval = 60)
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this. You could also use GitHub Actions to re-render `README.Rmd` every time you push. An example workflow can be found here: <https://github.com/r-lib/actions/tree/v1/examples>.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
